            <h1>2. Personally Identifiable Information</h1>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") outside of official means, which can include our Appeal's system and any other functionality or system used to collect any sort of information on you, including your email address, Discord® username, and so forth. We will NEVER sell, share, or otherwise make your PII known to any individual, third party, or organization. The only exception to this is if there is a request from Law Enforcement.</p>
            <p>For information on how we protect your data, please review section 6.</p>
        </div>

<div class="section">
            <h1>3. Age Verification</h1>
            <p>ACRP enforces age verification to ensure that no users under 13 access our services, in compliance with the COPPA and other applicable U.S. laws. Verification may occur through two methods:</p>
<br>
<h3> i. AI-based facial analysis</h3> <p>A user’s facial image may be analyzed to estimate age. These images and any derived biometric data are not permanently stored and are deleted immediately after analysis. Only non-identifying age information, such as age group, is retained in our secure database.</p><br>
<h3> ii. Screening</h3> <p>Users may be asked to provide their Date of Birth, country of residence, and grade level. This information is used solely to determine age eligibility. Raw Date of Birth and other sensitive information are not stored; only derived age group and verification outcomes are retained. Users under 13 are prohibited from accessing the platform, and no additional personal information from these users is collected or retained.</p><br><p>
All verification data is processed and stored using industry-standard security measures. Audit logs are maintained only for compliance monitoring and enforcement of age restrictions. In the event of a data breach or unauthorized access, ACRP will follow all applicable notification, mitigation, and legal requirements. Verification data is never sold or shared with third parties and is used strictly to enforce age restrictions, prevent underage access, and maintain the safety and compliance of our platform.

            <h1>4. General Information We Collect</h1>
            <p>In general, we collect little information on you, such as emails, Discord®, and Roblox® usernames, and/or profile link(s), Messages you send across our services, and Browser Information. Please note that other information collected is collected by the platforms we use/rely on, such as Discord®, Roblox®, Google®, and Cloudflare®.</p>

            <h1>5. How We Use Your Data</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>We collect your email address. Your email is used so we can give you access to documents, webpages, and accounts if you decide to become staff or join a department.</li>
                <li>We collect your Roblox and Discord usernames and/or profile link(s) if applicable to be able to identify who you are. There is no other purpose to this.</li>
                <li>We collect the messages that you send, edit, or delete across the services so we can moderate your messages in accordance with our Terms of Service and Community Standards.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>6. How We Secure Your Data</h1>
            <p>We take precautions to protect the information users send to us. This applies whether the data comes through our website, support forms, or any other part of our service. The way we handle this information may vary depending on the context, but in many cases, some level of protection, such as encryption or restricted access, may be used. Certain types of data, such as face photos, images of your ID, or written messages, are treated with additional care when necessary. We only use that kind of data for its intended purpose, such as verifying account ownership or age. Once we've completed the process that required the data, we typically remove it from our systems. We do not intentionally share sensitive user information with others. That includes photos, private messages, or personal documentation submitted for support purposes. If there is a rare case where we are required to release information, such as by law, we'll comply as needed, but these situations are uncommon. The level of protection we apply may very dependiong on how and where the data is submitted. Not all parts of our platform are built with the same level of security, and users should keep in mind when sharing any personal information. While we aim to prevent unauthorized access, we don't guarantee full protection in every scenario. No system is perfect. We can't claim to be fully secure, and we don't suggest that any platform can be. When we do what we can with the tools available to us, users should always use good judgment and only share what they are comfortable with providing.</p>
        </div>

<div class="section">
            <h1>7. Data Requests</h1>
            <p>You may request your data or request to have it deleted at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:legal@acrp.work">legal@acrp.work</a>. We will respond via email within 7 days.</p>

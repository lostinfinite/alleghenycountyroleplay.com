            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Services, including but not limited to our Website, Discord Bots, Custom Game Integrations, "Departments", and Automated Custom Applications used for verification.</p>

            <p>You will follow all articles, clauses, and rules outlined in our Terms and our Community Standards as described and written.</p>
            <p>For U.S. users, Allegheny County Roleplay's Arbitration Agreement (Section 3) outlines how disputes between you and Allegheny County Roleplay will be resolved. Specifically, these Allegheny County Roleplay Terms contain A BINDING, INDIVIDUAL, ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THIS MEANS THAT YOU GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO BRING AN ACTION IN COURT, INDIVIDUALLY OR AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION.</p>
            <p>PLEASE READ THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY ROLEPLAY TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE BEGINNING TO USE THE SERVICES, PLATFORMS, AND SERVERS WE MANAGE, AS THEY SET FORTH A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ALLEGHENY COUNTY ROLEPLAY.

            <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY (A "MINOR" ) IN YOUR JURISDICTION OR STATE OF RESIDENCE, BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OR SERVERS, YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN MUST READ AND AGREE TO THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY ROLEPLAY TERMS. BY PERMITTING A MINOR TO USE THE SERVICES, A MINOR'S PARENT BECOMES SUBJECT TO THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY ROLEPLAY TERMS AND AGREES TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE MINOR'S ACTIVITIES ON THE SERVICES, PLATFORM, OR SERVERS, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF ANY VIRTUAL CONTENT FROM US.</p>
            <p>These Terms may be updated at any time. We reserve the right to modify these Terms, along with any other legal documentation, at our sole discretion and without prior notice, explanation, consent, or approval. Your continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of any such changes. Changes shall be effective as of the "Last Updated" date atop of this page.</p>

            <p>We ask that all users respect the Terms of Service, Community Standards, and Privacy Policy of each of the third-party platforms we utilize; failure to do so will result in a restriction from Allegheny County Roleplay, as those same Terms of Service, Community Standards, and Privacy Policies govern us.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>3. Arbitration Agreement</h1>
            <p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> By using our services or accessing any Platform, Product, or Servers by Allegheny County Roleplay, you and Allegheny County Roleplay agree to resolve any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. This includes any claims based on conduct that occurred before this agreement and claims that may arise after termination.</p>
            <p><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> You and Allegheny County Roleplay agree that all arbitration proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not as a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action. You acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration.</p>
            <p><strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and applicable U.S. federal arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or another mutually agreed-upon arbitrator provider, under the applicable rules in effect at the time of filing.</p>
            <p><strong>Location and Procedure.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed, arbitration will be conducted remotely via written submissions, phone, or video conference. If a hearing is required, it will be held in the U.S. county where you reside or another location agreed upon by both parties.</p>
            <p><strong>Exceptions.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring a claim in small claims court if the court qualifies, or seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened misuse of intellectual property or confidential information.</p>
            <p><strong>Opt-Out Right.</strong> If you are a new user of the Services, you may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting these Terms by sending written notice to ownership@acrp.work. Your notice must include your full name, Discord® Username, address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration.</p>

If you dispute any charges directly with your payment processor, Allegheny County Roleplay may be restricted in the assistance, including any refund, that Allegheny County Roleplay can provide due to prohibitions under the payment provider's dispute process.
